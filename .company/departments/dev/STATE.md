# Dev / Engineering -- State

Stack: see `.company/steering/tech-stack.md`. Build spec: `docs/01-architecture.md` through `docs/07-roadmap.md`.

## Recent Work (from git history, most recent first)
- Animated wallet demo added to homepage, replacing static card mockup
- Mobile-first pass: fixed touch-target/layout issues (3 items)
- Pinned Vercel functions to `dub1` (Dublin) to match Supabase's `eu-west-1`
- Deferred jsPDF/html-to-image loading to only fire on poster download (perf)
- Sitewide button hover/press feedback audit

This indicates active polish/hardening work consistent with the Phase 6 production-readiness stage (see `.company/ROADMAP.md`) rather than new-feature MVP work.

## Known Open Items (documented, not inferred)
Per `docs/07-roadmap.md` Phase 6 sub-phase 1 ("Security & production-readiness hardening"), these were flagged as real issues to fix:
- Unauthenticated wallet-pass-download endpoint
- Non-durable rate limiting
- Hardcoded dashboard branding

**Status of these three fixes: unconfirmed.** Verify current state in code before assuming they're resolved or still open.

## Current Focus (per CEO, 2026-08)
Phase 6 production-readiness: security fixes, finishing wallet integrations (Apple/Google already working), finishing billing (Stripe not yet live), and MVP launch prep. No external funding -- default to low-cost/free infrastructure choices.

## Gaps
- No CI pipeline found (`.github/workflows` absent) -- Vitest tests exist locally but aren't confirmed to run automatically on PRs
- Per-task sprint breakdown for the current focus above isn't itemized yet -- next `/ai-ceo:dev:sprint` run should produce one
